# Trying to ask nvim not to leak any piece of the edited text to the filesystem
# (barring the writes to the given location, which should hopefully sit under /dev/shm).
# This is an ugly hack.
# It seems that the right solution would be to run nvim in a sandbox that discards writes to any location
# except the very file in question.
# But for now we go with a crippled neovim:
nvim -u NONE -c 'set viminfo= shada= noswapfile noundofile nobackup nowritebackup noshelltemp history=0 nomodeline secure' "$@"

## An idea of a cleaner solution:
#bwrap \
#  --unshare-all             \
#  --ro-bind / /             \
#  --proc /proc              \
#  --ro-bind /sys /sys       \
#  --dev /dev                \
#  --tmpfs /tmp              \
#  --dir ~/.local/share/nvim \
#  --bind $EDITED_FILE_PATH $EDITED_FILE_PATH \
#  nvim $EDITED_FILE_PATH
